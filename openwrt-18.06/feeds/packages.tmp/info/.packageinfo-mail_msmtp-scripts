Description:   msmtp-scripts are scripts wrappers around the msmtp SMTP client that
 add queueing, logging to syslog or file, and a subset of sendmail/postfix
 mailq/postsuper/postqueue commands implemented in a compatible fashion.
 This package contains the msmtpq-ng and msmtpq-ng-queue
 wrappers around msmtp, which provide the bulk of the
 functionality.

Title: Forwarding only SMTP with queuing (as MTA)

Description:   msmtp-scripts are scripts wrappers around the msmtp SMTP client that
 add queueing, logging to syslog or file, and a subset of sendmail/postfix
 mailq/postsuper/postqueue commands implemented in a compatible fashion.
 This package provides sendmail, mailq, postfix,
 and postsuper symlinks to wrappers that configure
 msmtpq-ng for use as the system mail transport
 agent via the sendmail command.

**NB**: In order for msmtpq-ng-mta aka sendmail to
send mail for non-root users (not just queue it
after failing), the user must have permissions to
access /etc/msmtprc -- package msmtp sets msmtprc
to rw only by root by default as a security measure
(it _can_ contain information like passwords with
which to send mail through your email server).

There are a couple of choices.  One is to leave
the default permissions (in which cases the mail
will queue and fail to send until the mailq -q
runner which runs in a root crontab sends the mail).
Another is to give any non-root daemon users (or
any other users) group access (i.e. create a
group for all the users who should be able to
send mail, add the users to it, and give the
group read-only permissions on the msmtrpc).
A final option (which is only resonable if you
have no secrets in msmtprc because you are
sending unauthenticated mail to a server that
accepts mail directly for the intended user --
usually that means a self-hosted system mail
server, rather than trying to send mail to
public servers (which don't typically accept
mail from normal user IP addresses, even if
you ISP doesn't block the traffic) is to
make msmtprc world readable.

The first option is probably the best choice
for most users, as it just means a 15
minute delay in the mail getting off the
system, and doesn't involve special permissions
for non-root daemons or users.
